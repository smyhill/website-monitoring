# website-monitoring
- A python script to monitor data on a website for changes and send sms updates.
- I created this to monitor changes on an apartment buildings site but this can be repurposed for whatever site you want to watch.

- Select the website and choose which tags to specifically check for changes.
- Replace the phone numbers with your own numbers to recieve updates -- make sure to use the proper corresponding carrier.
- Change the monitoring frequency to make the updates come at a convienent interval.
- More changes to come to make this more estensible to other websites

- In sms.py fill in the details with your gmail and password. Must be a gmail.
- If you have 2-factor auth on your account you will need to crete an app-specific gmail password via [this guide](https://umd.service-now.com/itsupport?id=kb_article&article=KB0015112&sys_kb_id=76433076dbdf8c904cb035623996194b&spa=1)
